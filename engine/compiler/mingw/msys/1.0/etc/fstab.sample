# /etc/fstab.sample -- sample mount table configuration for MSYS.

# Lines with a "#" in column one are interpreted as comment lines;
# with the exception of comments described as "magic", neither these
# lines, nor any blank lines, are interpreted as configuration.

# Comment lines which are described as "magic" should neither be
# deleted, nor edited manually; ignoring this advice may cause your
# MSYS installation to malfunction.

# When running MSYS from a portable device, such as a USB thumb drive,
# the following "magic" comment is used to track changes in host drive
# letter assignment, so allowing MSYS-Portable start-up hooks to remap
# mount table entries which refer to the relocated device:
#
# MSYSROOT=C:/MinGW/msys/1.0

# The mount table configuration follows below.  The line format is
# simple: you specify the Win32 path, followed by one or more space or
# tab delimiters, followed by the mount point name.  In a typical UNIX
# installation, each mount point must exist as a named directory on a
# physically accessible device, before it can actually be used as a
# mount point.  For this implementation the "must exist" requirement
# is not enforced; however, it will assist programs such as find, and
# readline's tab completion if each does physically exist.

# Win32_Path				Mount_Point
#-------------------------------------	-----------
C:/MinGW				/mingw

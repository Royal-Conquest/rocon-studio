# Cpp+SDL+VScode Starter with Examples

This repository contains SDL2-2.0.12 runtime library at root directory. You can replace it at your will. Latest version of SDL2 runtime can be found in link below.

### Setup

\*Setup for Windows user.
Download MinGW and install it. Download SDL development libraries(MinGw version) and copy "x86_64-w64-mingw32" folder and overwrite {Your Mingw64 "x86_64-w64-mingw32" folder} which can be found in your MinGW Installation path.

You can find more detailed description with screenshots from "VScode+SDL2 configuration tutorial" reference below.
But you don't need to create tasks.json, launch.json and c_cpp_properties.json files yourself. I already setup them. Just replace the **commented** lines with your own MinGW paths.

\*Haven't setup with MacOS, but you could easily find it elsewhere.

### Run

Press F5 on Vscode. Debug will be run based on .vscode settings.

### Examples

Copy source codes from examples and paste in src path or just run in example folder.

Examples are following "How To Make A Game In C++ & SDL2 From Scratch!" which is showing how to build BirchEngine.
